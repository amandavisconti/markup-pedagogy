Team MARKUP evolved as a group project in Neil Fraistat's Technoromanticism graduate seminar (English 738T) during the Spring 2012 term at the University of Maryland, augmented by several students in the \"sister\" course taught by Andrew Stauffer at the University of Virginia. The project involved using git and GitHub to manage a collaborative encoding project, learning TEI and the use of the Oxygen XML editor for markup and validation, and the encoding and quality-control checking of nearly 100 pages of Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ manuscript (each UMD student encoded ten pages, while the UVa students divided a ten-page chunk among themselves).\r\n\r\nWe're hard at work on a group blog post about the process of our encoding project; I'll link to this post once it's been published. Our primary mode of discussion and recording was a single unwieldy GoogleDoc, the content of which is represented here in more handy form.\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n1. Because this was a course project, we froze our relationship to the schema at the point when we turned to quality encoding: April 7th, 2012. Subsequent updates to the SGA schema might render some of this information incorrect.\r\n\r\n2. Also note that since this documentation was created by newcomers to TEI encoding, it might contain inaccuracies beyond disjoint with the current SGA schema.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n**GitHub Pages and Documentation** written by Team MARKUP Organizer Amanda Visconti (@amandavisconti), _except for the_\r\n\r\n**Questions and Answers Page**, which was written collaboratively by Team MARKUP\r\n\r\n* Amanda Visconti (@amandavisconti)\r\n\r\n* Jen Ausden\r\n* Michael Gossett\r\n* Amanda Giffi\r\n* Nigel Lepianka\r\n* Clifford Hichar\r\n* LaRonika Thomas\r\n* Phil Stewart\r\n* Eliza Fox (UVa)\r\n* Sarah Storti (UVa)\r\n* Tess Goodman (UVa)\r\n* Christina Sohn (UVa)\r\n\r\nwith some assistance in the Answers section from SGA staff Trevor Munoz, Neil Fraistat, Travis Brown, and David Brookshire"}
